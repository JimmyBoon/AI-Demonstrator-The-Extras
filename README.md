# AI-Demonstrator-The-Extras
C# Scripts for my Unity3d AI demonstration project.

Description: 'The Extras' is an AI demonstration, where the characters explore, eat, drink, interact and live in their own world. As an AI demonstration, ‘The Extras’ is not actually a game, it could be considered as a component of a future RPG type game, where the characters are a form of active scenery.

Key Features:
- Intelligent Camera System
- Character AI
- Character Conversation System
- Day/Night Effects
- Weather System

Future Development: A possible development would be to create a movie like experience, where the characters play out a story automously, based on their biographies and random behaviour
